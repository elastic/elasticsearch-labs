We will automatically enroll you in Original Medicare (Part A and Part B) when you become eligible. We will mail you the information a few months before you become eligible.\nBecause you must pay a premium for Part B coverage, you can turn it down. However, if you decide to sign up for Part B later, your coverage can be delayed and you may have to pay a late enrollment penalty for as long as you have Part B coverage. Residents of Puerto Rico or foreign countries will NOT automatically receive Part B. They must elect this benefit.\nIf you don’t get Social Security benefits and are not ready to apply for them yet, you should sign up for Medicare three months before your 65th birthday. The easiest way to apply for Medicare is by using our online application or you can make an appointment by calling us at 1-800-772-1213 (TTY 1-800-325-0778), 8:00 a.m. – 7:00 p.m., Monday through Friday.",
