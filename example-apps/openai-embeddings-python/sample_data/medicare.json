    "title": "How do I sign up for Medicare?",
    "content": "If you already get Social Security benefits, you do not need to sign up for Medicare. We will automatically enroll you in Original Medicare (Part A and Part B) when you become eligible. We will mail you the information a few months before you become eligible. Because you must pay a premium for Part B coverage, you can turn it down. However, if you decide to sign up for Part B later, your coverage can be delayed and you may have to pay a late enrollment penalty for as long as you have Part B coverage. Residents of Puerto Rico or foreign countries will NOT automatically receive Part B. They must elect this benefit. If you don't get Social Security benefits and are not ready to apply for them yet, you should sign up for Medicare three months before your 65th birthday. The easiest way to apply for Medicare is by using our online application or you can make an appointment by calling us at 1-800-772-1213 (TTY 1-800-325-0778), 8:00 a.m. - 7:00 p.m., Monday through Friday."

    "content": "Medicare is a health insurance program for people age 65 or older. Some younger people are eligible for Medicare including people with disabilities, permanent kidney failure and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's disease or ALS). Medicare helps with the cost of health care, but it does not cover all medical expenses or the cost of most long-term care. Original Medicare included: Part A—Hospital insurance helps pay for inpatient care in a hospital or limited time at a skilled nursing facility (following a hospital stay), and some home health care and hospice care. Part B—Medical insurance helps pay for doctors' services and many other medical services and supplies that the hospital insurance does not cover. Other parts of Medicare are: Part C—Medicare Advantage plans are offered by private companies and approved by Medicare. These plans generally help you pay the medical costs not covered by Original Medicare. Part D—Prescription drug coverage helps pay for prescribed medications."
