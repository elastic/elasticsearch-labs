# Elasticsearch example apps

## Overview

The following example apps demonstrate Elasticsearch for a variety of use cases, such as semantic search and retrieval augmented generation, using different programming languages and frameworks.

Use these apps as a starting point for your own projects.

## Apps

- [ElasticDocs GPT](./ElasticDocs_GPT/README.md). Combine Elasticsearch with the question answering power of ChatGPT. Use the ChatGPT API with your own UI.
- [ElasticGPT plugin](./ElasticGPT_Plugin/README.md). Implement a ChatGPT plugin and extend ChatGPT usage to any content indexed into Elasticsearch. This enables you to use the ChatGPT UI.
- [OpenAI embeddings](./OpenAI-embeddings/README.md). Use OpenAI embeddings at index time and in Elastic kNN queries. Available in [JavaScript](./OpenAI-embeddings/OpenAI-JS/README.md) and [Python](./OpenAI-embeddings/OpenAI-Py/README.md) versions.
- [Workplace search](./Workplace-Search/README.md). Build a semantic search experience for organizational/workplace data.
- [relevance-workbench](./relevance-workbench/README.md). A Python application that allows you to compare results ranking between the **Elastic Learned Sparse Encoder** model and BM25.
