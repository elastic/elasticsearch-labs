# Example apps 💻

The following example applications demonstrate Elasticsearch for a variety of use cases, such as semantic search and retrieval augmented generation, using different programming languages and frameworks.

Use these apps as a starting point for your own projects.

The applications are organized into the following folders:

- [`openai-embeddings`](openai-embeddings/README.md). Use OpenAI embeddings at index time and in Elastic kNN queries.

- [`relevance-workbench`](relevance-workbench/README.md). A Python application that allows you to compare results ranking between the **Elastic Learned Sparse Encoder** model and BM25.

- [`workplace-search`](workplace-search/README.md). Build a semantic search experience for organizational/workplace data.
