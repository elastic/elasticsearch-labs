    "[Semantic reranking](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/semantic-reranking.html) is an incredibly powerful tool for boosting the performance of a search experience or a RAG tool. It lets us immediately add semantic search capabilities to existing Elasticsearch installations out there."
