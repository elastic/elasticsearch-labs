    "### How to combine App Search queries with semantic text\n",

    "We will now provide an example on how to combine the previous two queries into a single query that applies both BM25 search and semantic search.\n",
    "In the previous examples, we have a `bool` query with `should` clauses.\n",
    "We will combine them in a single `bool` query and wrap this `bool` query in a `rule_query`.\n",
    "The `rule_query` is used to pin results based on the query string, similarly to App Search curations.\n",
    "The high-level structure of the query is following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "GET [DEST-INDEX]\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"query\": {\n",
    "    \"rule_query\": {\n",
    "      \"organic\": {\n",
    "        \"bool\": {\n",
    "          \"should\": [\n",
    "            // multi_match query with best_fields from App Search generated query\n",
    "            // multi_match query with cross_fields from App Search generated query\n",
    "            // text_expansion queries for sparse_vector fields\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We are again using `min_score` to exclude less relevant results.\n",
    "In our example we are not boosting any of the `should` clauses, but this can be a way to boost ELSER results over BM25 results."
