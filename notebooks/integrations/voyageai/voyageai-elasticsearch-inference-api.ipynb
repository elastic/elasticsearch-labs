Mash the steamed pumpkin with a potato masher and strain the liquid into a bowl. Reserve the liquid and set pumpkin puree aside.\\nIn the same large pot, put the reserved liquid from the pumpkin (about 1/2 to 2/3 cup) and add cinnamon sticks and cloves. Bring liquid to a boil and then remove from the heat. Replace lid and let steep for 30 minutes.\\nRemove cinnamon and cloves and add pumpkin puree to the liquid. Add the piloncillo and over medium-low heat let it melt into the pumpkin puree, stirring occasionally so it will not burn or stick to the pot. The pumpkin puree will turn a dark color with the piloncillo making it sweeter.\\nOnce the piloncillo has melted, lower the heat to low and let simmer uncovered until all the water evaporates. Remove from heat and allow pumpkin puree to cool down before refrigerating, about 15 minutes.\\nTo help puree set, place in the refrigerator for 3 hours or overnight. If some liquid separates, remove it with a spoon before using so the filling is not watery.\\nYou can make the empanada dough after your filling has chilled.\\nMix the first 3 dry ingredients. Cut in the shortening. It is best to use your hands. Add the eggs, milk, sugar, and cinnamon. Continue to work in with your hands until you have a soft dough. Split the dough in half, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for about 20 to 30 minutes.\\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F.\\nTake out half the dough and split it into 12 equal balls of dough.\\nOn a floured surface, roll out the dough balls into small round circles. Place a small dollop of pumpkin filling on one half of each of the dough circles. Wet the bottom edge of the circles with water to help seal the two halves. Fold over the dough to cover filling and seal off the edges with a fork by pressing down along the edges. This also makes for a pretty pattern when baked. Repeat with remaining dough and filling.\\nBrush each empanada with some canned evaporated milk or egg whites, sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar mixture. Puncture the top of each empanada with a fork to allow steam to escape while baking.\\nSpray a large cookie sheet with cooking spray, place the empanadas on the cookie sheet and bake for 15 to 20 minutes on middle rack in the oven. If after 15 minutes you notice the bottoms of the empanadas starting to brown, move the cookie sheet to the top rack and continue to bake for the last 5 minutes, until golden brown.\\nEnjoy the empanadas warm or at room temperature. Refrigerate baked empanadas for a few days.

      "\n",
      "**Title**: Liu Shaokun's Spicy Buckwheat Noodles with Chicken\n",
      "\n",
      "**Ingredients**:\n",
      "- 3 cups chicken broth or water (24 fl oz)\n",
      "- 1 lb skinless boneless chicken breast halves (2)\n",
      "- 1/2 lb dried buckwheat noodles such as soba noodles\n",
      "- 1 tablespoon peanut oil\n",
      "- 3 tablespoons Chinese black vinegar\n",
      "- 1 tablespoon light soy sauce\n",
      "- 1 tablespoon dark soy sauce\n",
      "- 1 tablespoon chile oil containing sesame oil (such as Chiu Chow Chili Oil from Lee Kum Kee), plus some of the sediment from the jar\n",
      "- 2 garlic cloves, minced\n",
      "- 1/2 teaspoon sugar\n",
      "- 1/8 teaspoon salt\n",
      "- 3 scallions (green parts only), thinly sliced\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons soy nuts (roasted salted soybeans)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Instructions**:\n",
      "1. Bring the chicken broth to a simmer in a 3-quart saucepan. Add chicken and simmer, uncovered, for 6 minutes. Remove the pan from heat and cover, letting it stand until the chicken is cooked through, about 15 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a plate and allow it to cool for at least 10 minutes, reserving the broth for another use.\n",
      "2. While the chicken is poaching, bring 4 quarts of salted cold water to a boil in a 5- to 6-quart saucepan over moderately high heat. Stir in the noodles, then add 1/2 cup cold water. When the water returns to a boil, add another 1/2 cup cold water, bringing it to a boil again, stirring. Repeat once more, or until the noodles are just tender but still firm and chewy throughout.\n",
      "3. Drain the noodles in a colander and rinse well under cold water to cool, then drain thoroughly. Toss the noodles with the peanut oil in a large bowl.\n",
      "4. Stir together the vinegar, soy sauces, chile oil with sediment, garlic, sugar, and salt in another bowl until the sugar is dissolved. Add this mixture to the noodles and toss until coated.\n",
      "5. Shred the chicken with your fingers into 1/4-inch-wide strips. Add to the noodles, tossing to combine. Sprinkle with scallions and soy nuts.\n",
      "\n",
      "This recipe is a delightful way to enjoy spicy noodles with a good balance of flavors from the soy sauces and the heat from the chile oil. If you’re looking for a vegetarian version, you might substitute the chicken with tofu or your choice of vegetables. Enjoy your spicy noodles! If you meant a different style of spicy noodles, try searching for \"Thai spicy noodles\" or \"Sichuan spicy noodles\" for a broader range of options.\n"
