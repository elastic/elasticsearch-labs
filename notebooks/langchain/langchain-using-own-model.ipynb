First we will download sample dataset and  split documents into chunks using langchain and then index into elasticsearch through [ElasticsearchStore.from_documents](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/vectorstores/langchain.vectorstores.elasticsearch.ElasticsearchStore.html#langchain.vectorstores.elasticsearch.ElasticsearchStore.from_documents).\n",

During the indexing, dense vector fields are generated and is store within the index. We can either provide an embedding function or provide a `query_model_id` to embed the query. In this notebook we will provide a `query_model_id` - during the query time. \n",
