First,  we  split the documents into chunks using `langchain` and then index into elasticsearch through [`ElasticsearchStore.from_documents`](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/vectorstores/langchain.vectorstores.elasticsearch.ElasticsearchStore.html#langchain.vectorstores.elasticsearch.ElasticsearchStore.from_documents). \n",

Hence, the inference is handled within elasticsearch.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `similarity_search` performs semantic search using `text_expansion` and sets the query.\n",
