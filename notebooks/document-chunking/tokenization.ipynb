    "# Tokenization for Semantic Search (ELSER and E5)\n",
    "\n",
    "[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/elastic/elasticsearch-labs/blob/main/notebooks/search/tokenization.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "Elasticsearch offers [semantic search](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/semantic-search) models, most notably [ELSER](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/machine-learning/current/ml-nlp-elser.html) and [E5](https://www.elastic.co/search-labs/blog/articles/multilingual-vector-search-e5-embedding-model), to search through documents in a way that takes the text's meaning into account. Part of the semantic search process is breaking up texts into tokens (both for documents and for queries). Tokens are commonly thought of as words, but this is not completely accurate. Different semantic models use different concepts of tokens. Many treat punctuation separately and some break up compound words. For example ELSER (our English language model) uses the [`bert-base-uncased`](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased) tokenizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "For users of Elasticsearch it is important to know how texts are broken up into tokens because currently only the [first 512 tokens per field](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/machine-learning/8.12/ml-nlp-limitations.html#ml-nlp-elser-v1-limit-512) are considered. This means that when you index longer texts, all tokens after the 512th are ignored in your semantic search. Hence it is valuable to know the number of tokens for your input texts before choosing the right model and indexing method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently it is not possible to get the token count information via the API, so here we share the code for calculating token counts. This notebook also shows how to break longer text up into chunks of the right size so that no information is lost during indexing. Currently (as of version 8.12) this has to be done by the user. Future versions will remove this necessity and Elasticsearch will automatically create chunks behind the scenes."
