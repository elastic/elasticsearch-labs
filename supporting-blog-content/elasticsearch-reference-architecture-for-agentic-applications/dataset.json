    "content": "On March 2024, our production Node.js Express 4.17 API gateway experienced a critical prototype pollution vulnerability leading to remote code execution. The attack vector involved manipulating object prototypes through JSON payloads in POST requests. This affected all Express middleware processing user input. Immediate mitigation: upgrade to Express 4.18.2+, implement input validation, use Object.freeze() for critical objects. Related to CVE-2022-24999.",

Attackers can inject malicious scripts through comment fields and markdown rendering. This affects all authenticated users. Recommendation: upgrade to React 18+, use DOMPurify for HTML sanitization, implement Content Security Policy headers, avoid dangerouslySetInnerHTML with user content.",
