## Geospatial data ingest for ES|QL

This folder contains sample data used in various blogs about querying
Geospatial data using ES|QL. In particular:

* [Geospatial data ingest for ES|QL](https://www.elastic.co/search-labs/blog/geospatial-data-ingest)
* [Geospatial search with ES|QL](https://www.elastic.co/search-labs/blog/esql-geospatial-search-part-one)
* [Geospatial distance search with ES|QL](https://www.elastic.co/search-labs/blog/esql-geospatial-search-part-two)

Most of the data we used for the examples in these blogs were based on data we use internally for integration tests.
But some data was generated by the authors:

* [airports](airports/README.md)
* [drone](drone/README.md)

Each of these sets of data has different licensing requirements depending on
the original data sources. Please read the included README in each
directory for specific attribution and other licensing requirements.
