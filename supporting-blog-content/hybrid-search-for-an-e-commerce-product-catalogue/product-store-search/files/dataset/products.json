Whether you're looking for a striking or glamorous look for night time, or something more subtle and natural for wearing during the day, there is a shade for everyone. They dry quickly, and depending on the depth of colour desired, can be blended in on application or left to dry before blending for a more vivid look. Layering is also possible, but however you choose to use these liquid eye shadows they won't gather in crow's feet or fine lines around the eyes. The inclusion of patented beta glucan also means they're perfect for sensitive eyes. Pale Almond is subtle, natural, and perfect for daytime wear, and compliments our Bronzed Hazel liquid eye shadow if a duo tone is desired.",

Each lacquer is properly balanced with resin, plasticizer and nitrocellulose to provide a durable film that offers high gloss, exceptional wear and maximum protection for the nail.The lacquers provide durability for the ultimate in chip-free results, with each lacquer offering a carefully balanced blend of film formers that are not adversely affected when exposed to water or detergents. The formula is nonfading with lasting color fidelity over time, as the use of UV absorbers helps maintain the true colors. The lacquers maintain an excellent shelf life, with a formula that prevents pigment migration, striation, settling and syneresis over longer periods of time than most other nail enamel formulas. And, as we guarantee, the chip-resistant polishes promise superior wear and exceptional gloss retention, while helping to condition, protect, strengthen and reinforce the natural nail.",
