## 🤖 Asking to model: llama3.2

### 💡 Question: 
Can you summarize the performance issues in the API?
### 📝 Answer: 
According to the transcript, the performance issues in the API are:

1. Response times increase from 200ms to 3 seconds when handling 1,000+ queries per minute.
2. Complex Elasticsearch queries are slow, with an average execution time of 1.2 seconds.
3. Performance degrades during spikes.

These issues are attributed to the lack of caching and a complex Elasticsearch query setup.
