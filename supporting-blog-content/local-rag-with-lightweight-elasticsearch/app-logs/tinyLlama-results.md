## 🤖 Asking to model: TinyLlama

### 💡 Question: Can you summarize the performance issues in the API?
#### 📝  Answer: 
InfoRama has identified some issues with the seaRCSearch API, which was deployed last week. The performance of the API is causing delays and bottlenecks for key components such as query optimization, Redis cache, and infrastructure scaling. The team is working on a Redis cache implementation and Elasticsearch query optimization, but they need to get the SeaRCSearch API to scale efficiently by 6 instances at 70% CPU. The DeveloPMent Team has set three priorities: query optimization, Redis cache, and infrastructure scaling. The team is working on testing their progress and setting up automated scaling for load testing. In addition to these issues, the team identified complex Elasticsearch queries without a cchinig layer, which led to time-consuming and inefficient execution times.
