## 🤖 Asking to model: TinyLlama

### 💡 Question: Can you summarize the performance issues in the API?
#### 📝  Answer: 
During the week of September 16-20, 2025, the Development Team identified complex Elasticsearch queries and no automatic cachining layer. They completed SeaRChe search optimization but encountered performance bottlenecks requiring attention before production deployment. The team worked on implementing critical infrastructure components such as database schema and indexes, but also identified performance issues with seaRChe searches, and 95% of the remaining queries were considered critical. Despite these challenges, critical components completed by the end of the week for the upcoming migration on October 15th. The team worked on Elasticsearch query optimization and Redis cache implementation, as well as automated testing to ensure proper rollback and disaster recovery, while preparing deployment strategies for both phases of the project.
