### üí° Question: Can you summarize the performance issues in the API?
#### üìù Answer: 

`<think>`

We are given three files: 
  1. meeting_development-team_monday.txt (transcript from Monday, Sept 16, 2025)
  2. report_development-team.txt (weekly report for week of Sept 16-20, 2025)
  3. meeting_management-sync_friday.txt (transcript from Friday, Sept 20, 2025)

The question asks: "Can you summarize the performance issues in the API?"

We need to look for information about API performance issues in these files.

From the first file (meeting_development-team_monday.txt):
  - At [09:03] Sarah: "API works but performance degrades with 1,000+ queries per minute. Response times jump from 200ms to 3 seconds."
  - At [09:05] John: "Elasticsearch queries and no caching layer?"
  - At [09:06] Sarah: "Exactly. Complex queries are slow, and we need Redis caching."
  - At [09:13] John: "I'll optimize bool queries and add calculated index fields."
  - Also, in the same meeting: [09:17] Mike: "Also hitting CPU limits during spikes. Need auto-scaling."

From the second file (report_development-team.txt):
  - In "TECHNICAL CHALLENGES":
      - Critical: Search API degrades at 1,000+ queries/minute (200ms to 3+ seconds)
      - Root cause: Complex Elasticsearch queries without caching layer
      - Multi-filter searches average 1.2 seconds execution time

From the third file (meeting_management-sync_friday.txt):
  - [14:03] Emma: "Good progress. Users report 40% search speed improvement, but support tickets show peak hour performance issues."

So, the key performance issues in the API (specifically the search API) are:

1. The search API degrades significantly when handling more than 1,000 queries per minute, with response times increasing from 200ms to 3 seconds (or more).
2. The root cause is complex Elasticsearch queries without a caching layer.
3. Multi-filter searches take an average of 1.2 seconds to execute.
4. The team has been working on:
   - Implementing Redis caching (with a proposed 15-minute TTL and event-based invalidation)
   - Optimizing Elasticsearch queries (specifically bool queries and adding calculated index fields)
   - Setting up auto-scaling to handle CPU spikes (to 6 instances at 70% CPU)

Additionally, the meeting on Friday (Sept 20) notes that users have seen a 40% improvement in search speed but there are still peak hour performance issues (as reported in support tickets).

Therefore, the summary of performance issues in the API (focusing on the search API) is:

- The search API experiences a critical performance degradation when the query rate exceeds 1,000 queries per minute, causing response times to jump from 200ms to 3 seconds or more.
- The root cause is complex Elasticsearch queries without a caching layer, leading to slow response times for multi-filter searches (averaging 1.2 seconds).
- The team is addressing this with Redis caching, Elasticsearch query optimization, and infrastructure scaling.

We are to write a concise summary.

Let me structure the answer:

The API (specifically the search API) has the following performance issues:
1. Under heavy load (1,000+ queries per minute), response times degrade from 200ms to 3+ seconds.
2. Root cause: Complex Elasticsearch queries without a caching layer.
3. Multi-filter searches average 1.2 seconds execution time.

The team is working on fixing these by implementing Redis caching, optimizing Elasticsearch queries, and setting up auto-scaling.

We don't need to include the Friday meeting's 40% improvement because the question is about the issues that were identified (the current state). The meeting on Friday mentions that users report 40% improvement (so that's a positive note) but the issues (peak hour performance) are still present.

So, the summary should focus on the issues as they were identified in the Monday meeting and the report.

Answer:

The search API experiences significant performance degradation when handling more than 1,000 queries per minute, with response times increasing from 200ms to 3 seconds or more. The root cause is complex Elasticsearch queries without a caching layer, which also results in multi-filter searches taking an average of 1.2 seconds to execute. The development team is addressing these issues through Redis caching implementation, Elasticsearch query optimization, and infrastructure scaling.

Based on the meeting transcripts and weekly report provided, here's a concise summary of the API performance issues:

### Key Performance Issues in the Search API:
1. **Critical Degradation Under Load**:  
   - Response times jump from **200ms to 3+ seconds** when handling **1,000+ queries per minute** (identified in Monday meeting and weekly report).
   - Multi-filter searches average **1.2 seconds** execution time.

2. **Root Cause**:  
   - **Complex Elasticsearch queries** without a caching layer (confirmed by Sarah in Monday meeting).  
   - No Redis caching implementation (directly cited as the bottleneck).

3. **Secondary Impact**:  
   - Infrastructure is hitting **CPU limits during traffic spikes** (reported by Mike in Monday meeting), requiring auto-scaling.

4. **Current Progress**:  
   - Users have seen a **40% speed improvement** (per Friday meeting), but peak-hour performance issues persist in support tickets.  
   - The team is addressing this through:  
     - Redis caching (15-min TTL with event-based invalidation)  
     - Elasticsearch query optimization (bool queries + calculated index fields)  
     - Auto-scaling (target: 6 instances at 70% CPU)

### Why This Matters for Deployment:
The issues are critical enough that the migration timeline was adjusted to **phase the deployment** (Contact management first on Oct 15, full migration on Oct 30) to ensure stability before production. Without these fixes, the API would risk significant slowdowns during high-traffic periods.
