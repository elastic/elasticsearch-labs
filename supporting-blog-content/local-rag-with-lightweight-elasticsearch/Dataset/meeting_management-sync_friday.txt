MEETING TRANSCRIPT - MANAGEMENT SYNC
Date: Friday, September 20, 2025
Time: 02:00 PM - 03:00 PM
Participants: David (Project Manager), Alice (Tech Lead), Maria (QA Lead), Emma (Product Manager), Carlos (DevOps Manager)

[14:03] Emma: Good progress. Users report 40% search speed improvement, but support tickets show peak hour performance issues.

[14:05] Alice: We've identified bottlenecks. Working on Redis caching and Elasticsearch query optimization.

[14:06] David: Can we resolve issues without impacting October migration date?

[14:09] Alice: Recommend two-week extension for complete migration due to performance issues.

[14:10] Maria: QA agrees. Found data import blockers with special characters and integrity issues.

[14:12] Maria: Need one week to fix issues, another for complete re-testing.

[14:14] Carlos: Infrastructure supports extension for proper rollback and disaster recovery testing.

[14:15] Emma: Could we do partial migration on original date?

[14:17] Alice: Yes. Contact management module first, reports and analytics in phase two.

[14:21] Maria: Phased migration ideal for QA - validate each module independently.

[14:22] David: Proposal: Phase 1 - Contact management October 15th. Phase 2 - Complete migration October 30th.

[14:23] Alice: Reasonable timeline for performance fixes.

[14:24] Emma: Works from product perspective. Will update stakeholder communications.

[14:25] Maria: QA commits to these timelines.

[14:26] Carlos: Will prepare deployment strategies for both phases.

[14:32] David: Carlos, send deployment calendar by Monday. Thanks team!
