[Document(page_content='Day 6 (Thursday): Cloudy in the Pyrenees, with partly cloudy conditions in other areas clearing up later. Precipitation is not ruled out in northern Huesca. Minimum temperatures will mostly remain unchanged; maximum temperatures will rise in Zaragoza and northeast Teruel, with no significant changes elsewhere. West winds light to moderate, shifting to moderate southeast winds.\nIf President Pedro Sánchez does not recognize interim president Juan Guaidó after the 8-day ultimatum given to Nicolás Maduro to call for elections, it could jeopardize Spanish investments in Venezuela that total more than 41 billion euros. Spain is the primary foreign investor in Venezuela, and both the capital of its most emblematic companies and the properties of Spanish residents could be lost if Maduro remains in power, similar to what happened with the Cuban revolution, where Spaniards could not recover their investments. Venezuelan financial economists Rosana Sosa García and Boris Ackerman published a report this Monday on the local digital portal La Patilla, warning of the dangers to Spanish investments in Venezuela if Pedro Sánchez does not recognize the newly proclaimed interim president of the country. The non-recognition of Guaidó as "interim president" of Venezuela represents "a potential danger" for Spain and the European Union as a whole. The analysts reminded that the recent inclusion of the Venezuelan crisis on the agenda of the United Nations Security Council gave the issue global significance. They pointed out that any commercial or financial transactions involving state assets or other operations with Maduro and his regime lack legitimacy from the time of interim president Guaidó\'s swearing-in on January 23.\n\nRosa Sosa, who resides in Spain, stated that Guaidó\'s swearing-in was "dismissed at first by the Spanish government led by Sánchez but was not ignored by significant countries like England." She cited the example of the Bank of England, which legally rejected the repatriation of 1.2 billion dollars in gold requested by Maduro, who has been usurping the presidency since January 10. The Spanish Ministry of Commerce estimates that there are about a hundred companies established in Venezuela, such as BBVA, Repsol, Acciona, and others, representing direct Spanish investments amounting to 21.313 billion euros by the end of 2015. Economist Sosa notes that the socialist government of Pedro Sánchez "is jeopardizing the heritage of companies that generate direct jobs inside and outside of Spain." It similarly endangers the assets of Spaniards (individuals) who have investments in Venezuela, not only due to the decrease in their value but also due to the paralysis caused by the legal vacuum in which everyone is currently immersed.\n\n"The biggest losers in the catastrophe facing Venezuela are not the IBEX companies; it\'s the ordinary citizens, and the assessment of these losses becomes more necessary," Sosa affirms. Spanish residents and their descendants in Venezuela have suffered enormous property losses that surpass the decline in investments of large companies. If the Spanish population in Venezuela is estimated at over 415,000 inhabitants and the average personal wealth is calculated at 50,000 euros, including real estate and homes, "the loss would therefore exceed 20 billion euros, coinciding with the decline in the value of large companies\' investments." This loss is reflected in the devaluation of their homes and real estate, and the complete depreciation of productive assets, the report adds.'),
 Document(page_content='The current situation in Venezuela presents "a completely impoverished population living in dire conditions, without medicine, without food, and perhaps with the worst public services in the Western world. Spaniards residing or owning properties in Venezuela are not exempt from this situation; in fact, they are one of the populations most affected by the crisis." The transition to democracy will be the only path for hundreds of thousands of Spaniards to recover their assets in Venezuela.\nThe longest lunar eclipse in a hundred years is a wonderful phenomenon that can be seen with the naked eye throughout Spain. The Moon rises in the sky tinged with vivid reddish and orange hues, which is why it is called the "Blood Moon" or "Fire Moon," as it passes through the shadow cast by the planet Earth. To witness the eclipse, simply look up at the sky and find the Moon. The lunar eclipse will last for more than three hours, during which the Moon will be at least partially covered by Earth\'s shadow. However, the most spectacular phase, the total phase, when the Moon is completely tinted red, will extend for one hour and almost 43 minutes, a record time that will not be surpassed this century. Generally, this can be observed in Spain starting from 9:00 PM at the earliest, although it is recommended to start watching from 10:00 PM, when the Moon will be visible in the sky. Until 11:00 PM, the Moon will appear reddened, and from that moment on, it will begin to emerge from the shadow zone and its disc will gradually regain its whitish brightness. Around midnight, the entire lunar disc will have its usual color. Interestingly, if the Moon appears red and not darker, it is due to a phenomenon known as Rayleigh scattering, by which the Earth\'s atmosphere scatters light and filters out blue and violet colors. Those who cannot enjoy the night sky today can follow it live from Namibia through the "Sky-live.tv" channel. Those who can go outside and want to enjoy the eclipse more deeply have a golden opportunity in Madrid. Starting at 10:00 PM, the Madrid Planetarium and La Caixa Foundation, in collaboration with the Madrid Astronomical Association (AAM), will offer a public observation session with telescopes on the planetarium\'s esplanade, with free access.'),
 Document(page_content='The shortage of funds is not the only problem humanitarian agencies face. Damascus has decided to deny visas to UN and NGO workers operating in the country, Ging confirmed on Monday. "We have pending visas for numerous international workers from Western countries —such as the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, and one or two more countries— who are being denied visas because of their nationalities," explained the UN official. "This is something to which we strongly oppose, and we are working with the Syrian government to resolve it," he added.\n\nGing also warned of a possible food crisis in the country. Two UN agencies, the World Food Programme and the FAO —the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations—, have estimated that the country\'s wheat harvest would decrease by 700,000 tons this year. Syria consumes between four and five million tons of wheat per year and has had to import grain for over six years to meet the needs of its citizens. "We must be prepared to address this," declared Ging. In June, the United Nations provided food rations to 500,000 people and hopes to increase this number to 850,000 this month.\nThe session has been anything but calm. It promised to be so in the morning. And not just calm, but also positive. The Spanish selective index even surpassed the 10,500-point level. This was likely helped by the Bank of Spain\'s announcement that Spain\'s GDP grew by 0.4% in the first quarter. Additionally, there was a debt auction conducted by the Treasury. Over three years, it sold 1,348 million euros with an average return of 1.022%, below the previous 1.331%. Over five years, it issued 1,570 million euros with an average return of 1.663%, below the previous 1.869%. Over ten years, it sold 2.6 billion euros with a return of 3.059%, lower than the previous 3.291%. However, it began to falter after twelve-thirty, which is when it dropped below 10,500 points. The decline continued especially after three in the afternoon when the indicator started drifting, eventually falling below 10,400 points and marking a daily low under 10,350 points. The cause of the declines: Ukraine. The Ukrainian government\'s activity against pro-Russians has reactivated, and meanwhile, the Russian government responded by announcing new maneuvers. From that minimum level, the indicator began a recovery, ending the day at 10,462 points, a revaluation of 0.36%. In the end, what was supposed to be a calm and positive session turned into a quite volatile day. The Spanish selective index performed worse than Italy\'s Ftse Mib and France’s Cac 40, which gained 0.66% and 0.64% respectively, but better than Germany\'s Dax, which only rose by 0.05%. This occurred despite Germany publishing the Ifo index, which measures confidence in the German economy. It rose from 110.7 to 111.2 points, when experts expected it to settle at 110.5 points. Additionally, it increased due to better expectations: in that chapter, the indicator rose from 106.4 to 107.3 points, compared to the 105.8 points that analysts expected. In the evaluation of the current situation, it rose from 115.2 to 115.3 points, when experts expected it to be 115.7 points. Only one index ended in the red: Lisbon\'s PSI-20, which fell by 0.11%. \n\nBoost from the United States\nThe final recovery in Europe had to do with the behavior of the American stock market. There, indices, especially the Nasdaq, which gained around one percentage point, were celebrating the good results from Facebook and Apple and were moving upwards. Among the economic indicators of the day in the United States, the durable goods orders data was very good: they rose by 2.6% in March, above the 2% that analysts expected and higher than the 2.1% growth the previous month. Orders for durable goods excluding transportation rose by 2%, above the 0.6% that analysts expected. Excluding defense, they rose by 1.8%, below the 3% estimated by analysts. More durable goods orders indicate a boost to industrial production. The weekly unemployment data was somewhat worse, rising by 329,000 people, above the 310,000 expected by analysts. Additionally, the Kansas Fed\'s activity index fell from 22 to 12 points.'),
 Document(page_content='In the Spanish selective index, Sabadell led the gains with a revaluation of 2.78%. IAG followed, advancing by 1.64%. Técnicas Reunidas, FCC, and BBVA also advanced more than one percentage point. Among the major stocks, Santander and Telefónica also stood out, rising by 0.74% and 0.62% respectively. Inditex and Iberdrola rose around 0.35%. On the other hand, Gamesa was the worst performer, dropping by 2.12%. Following it were CaixaBank, Dia, Sacyr, Bankinter, and Jazztel, which fell by more than one percentage point. Bankia and Popular’s losses were close to 1%. In the Madrid General Stock Index, Amper led the gains with a revaluation of 5.26%. Following it was Codere, which also gained more than 5%. Barón de Ley and Liberbank gained more than three percentage points. In red, the worst performer was Inypsa, with a decline of 9.09%.\n\nSale of practically all bonds\nIn the debt market, the yield of all bonds rose. This means that yesterday, investors sold debt to buy stocks. The yield on the Spanish bond rose from 3.05% to 3.08%. The yield on the Italian bond rose from 3.09% to 3.12%. The yield on the German bond rose from 1.52% to 1.53%. With this behavior, Spain\'s risk premium barely increased from 153 to 155 basis points. Italy\'s risk premium rose from 157 to 159 basis points. In the currency market, the exchange rate between the euro and the dollar ended the day at 1.3824 units. In the commodities market, the Brent barrel rose by 1% to 110 dollars, while West Texas advanced by 0.48% to nearly 102 dollars. The price of gold advanced by 0.30% due to new tensions arising in Ukraine, but it ended the day still below 1,300 dollars, at 1,288 dollars per ounce. \n\nMarket Information\n- Live quotes of the Ibex\n- Continuous market\n- International markets.\nThere are at least 15 kilometers between the parish of the Central University of Venezuela (UCV) and the Eastern Cemetery in Caracas, where the march will take place on foot this Wednesday to transfer the body of councilman Fernando Albán, who was allegedly "murdered" and thrown from the 10th floor of the Sebin tower, the political police, according to opposition parties’ denunciations. The funeral march was called to begin at 11 am, local time, from the university parish to the Eastern Cemetery of La Guairita. The burial has become an act of protest and unity for the opposition to express the anger felt by the people of Caracas over the death of councilman Albán.\n\nFernando Albán, 56, was a councilman for the Libertador municipality of Caracas representing the Primero Justicia party. He was known for being a devout Catholic, which contradicts the official version that he committed suicide after being detained at the Simón Bolívar airport on October 5 when he was returning from the United Nations in New York where he was presenting complaints about the systematic human rights violations in Venezuela. No one has believed the official version that Albán committed suicide from the 10th floor of the Sebin tower, located in Plaza Venezuela, also known as "The Tomb," where political prisoners are tortured.\n\nThe National Assembly held a plenary session on Tuesday in his memory, condemning the politician’s murder. During the parliamentary event, Deputy Juan Miguel Matheus denounced that Fernando Albán was tortured on Sunday night. "On Sunday night they tortured him, and they tortured him in three ways: mechanical asphyxiation with a bag over his face, submersion in a barrel of water, trying to drown him, and with electricity. And in that, he lost his life, in that he died."\n\nFormer governor of Miranda state, Henrique Capriles Radonski, during the funeral services for councilman Fernando Albán at the National Assembly (AN), assured that from his party Primero Justicia (PJ) "we do not buy the story that Fernando Albán would be capable of taking his own life." Capriles Radonski asserted that the worst thing that could happen to Venezuela is for hatred to reign in the country and for something to be constructed on top of that hatred. "If there is a weapon of mass destruction, it is hatred in a situation like this where we are overwhelmed; if there is something we can say at this moment, it is that we want justice and for a transparent investigation to be conducted," he affirmed. He indicated that Venezuela is living on the edge. "What do we want in Venezuela, to kill each other, where the Government paves the way for this country to end in a civil war. Is that the destiny of Venezuela? I wouldn’t want us to be, every day the government contributes to the ground so that things cannot be solved in the way the majority wants, which is a peaceful solution," he said, indicating that he does not believe Albán thought of taking his own life since he was a man of faith and principles.')]
