[Document(page_content='Day 6 (Thursday): Cloudy in the Pyrenees, with partly cloudy conditions in other areas clearing up later. Precipitation is not ruled out in northern Huesca. Minimum temperatures will mostly remain unchanged; maximum temperatures will rise in Zaragoza and northeast Teruel, with no significant changes elsewhere.

Spain is the primary foreign investor in Venezuela, and both the capital of its most emblematic companies and the properties of Spanish residents could be lost if Maduro remains in power, similar to what happened with the Cuban revolution, where Spaniards could not recover their investments. Venezuelan financial economists Rosana Sosa García and Boris Ackerman published a report this Monday on the local digital portal La Patilla, warning of the dangers to Spanish investments in Venezuela if Pedro Sánchez does not recognize the newly proclaimed interim president of the country. The non-recognition of Guaidó as "interim president" of Venezuela represents "a potential danger" for Spain and the European Union as a whole. The analysts reminded that the recent inclusion of the Venezuelan crisis on the agenda of the United Nations Security Council gave the issue global significance. They pointed out that any commercial or financial transactions involving state assets or other operations with Maduro and his regime lack legitimacy from the time of interim president Guaidó\'s swearing-in on January 23.\n\nRosa Sosa, who resides in Spain, stated that Guaidó\'s swearing-in was "dismissed at first by the Spanish government led by Sánchez but was not ignored by significant countries like England." She cited the example of the Bank of England, which legally rejected the repatriation of 1.2 billion dollars in gold requested by Maduro, who has been usurping the presidency since January 10. The Spanish Ministry of Commerce estimates that there are about a hundred companies established in Venezuela, such as BBVA, Repsol, Acciona, and others, representing direct Spanish investments amounting to 21.313 billion euros by the end of 2015. Economist Sosa notes that the socialist government of Pedro Sánchez "is jeopardizing the heritage of companies that generate direct jobs inside and outside of Spain." It similarly endangers the assets of Spaniards (individuals) who have investments in Venezuela, not only due to the decrease in their value but also due to the paralysis caused by the legal vacuum in which everyone is currently immersed.\n\n"The biggest losers in the catastrophe facing Venezuela are not the IBEX companies; it\'s the ordinary citizens, and the assessment of these losses becomes more necessary," Sosa affirms. Spanish residents and their descendants in Venezuela have suffered enormous property losses that surpass the decline in investments of large companies. If the Spanish population in Venezuela is estimated at over 415,000 inhabitants and the average personal wealth is calculated at 50,000 euros, including real estate and homes, "the loss would therefore exceed 20 billion euros, coinciding with the decline in the value of large companies\' investments." This loss is reflected in the devaluation of their homes and real estate, and the complete depreciation of productive assets, the report adds.'),
 Document(page_content='The current situation in Venezuela presents "a completely impoverished population living in dire conditions, without medicine, without food, and perhaps with the worst public services in the Western world. Spaniards residing or owning properties in Venezuela are not exempt from this situation; in fact, they are one of the populations most affected by the crisis." The transition to democracy will be the only path for hundreds of thousands of Spaniards to recover their assets in Venezuela.\nThe longest lunar eclipse in a hundred years is a wonderful phenomenon that can be seen with the naked eye throughout Spain. The Moon rises in the sky tinged with vivid reddish and orange hues, which is why it is called the "Blood Moon" or "Fire Moon," as it passes through the shadow cast by the planet Earth. To witness the eclipse, simply look up at the sky and find the Moon. The lunar eclipse will last for more than three hours, during which the Moon will be at least partially covered by Earth\'s shadow. However, the most spectacular phase, the total phase, when the Moon is completely tinted red, will extend for one hour and almost 43 minutes, a record time that will not be surpassed this century. Generally, this can be observed in Spain starting from 9:00 PM at the earliest, although it is recommended to start watching from 10:00 PM, when the Moon will be visible in the sky. Until 11:00 PM, the Moon will appear reddened, and from that moment on, it will begin to emerge from the shadow zone and its disc will gradually regain its whitish brightness. Around midnight, the entire lunar disc will have its usual color. Interestingly, if the Moon appears red and not darker, it is due to a phenomenon known as Rayleigh scattering, by which the Earth\'s atmosphere scatters light and filters out blue and violet colors. Those who cannot enjoy the night sky today can follow it live from Namibia through the "Sky-live.tv" channel. Those who can go outside and want to enjoy the eclipse more deeply have a golden opportunity in Madrid. Starting at 10:00 PM, the Madrid Planetarium and La Caixa Foundation, in collaboration with the Madrid Astronomical Association (AAM), will offer a public observation session with telescopes on the planetarium\'s esplanade, with free access.'),
 Document(page_content='The shortage of funds is not the only problem humanitarian agencies face. Damascus has decided to deny visas to UN and NGO workers operating in the country, Ging confirmed on Monday. "We have pending visas for numerous international workers from Western countries —such as the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, and one or two more countries— who are being denied visas because of their nationalities," explained the UN official. "This is something to which we strongly oppose, and we are working with the Syrian government to resolve it," he added.\n\nGing also warned of a possible food crisis in the country. Two UN agencies, the World Food Programme and the FAO —the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations—, have estimated that the country\'s wheat harvest would decrease by 700,000 tons this year. Syria consumes between four and five million tons of wheat per year and has had to import grain for over six years to meet the needs of its citizens. "We must be prepared to address this," declared Ging. In June, the United Nations provided food rations to 500,000 people and hopes to increase this number to 850,000 this month.\nThe session has been anything but calm. It promised to be so in the morning. And not just calm, but also positive. The Spanish selective index even surpassed the 10,500-point level. This was likely helped by the Bank of Spain\'s announcement that Spain\'s GDP grew by 0.4% in the first quarter. Additionally, there was a debt auction conducted by the Treasury. Over three years, it sold 1,348 million euros with an average return of 1.022%, below the previous 1.331%. Over five years, it issued 1,570 million euros with an average return of 1.663%, below the previous 1.869%. Over ten years, it sold 2.6 billion euros with a return of 3.059%, lower than the previous 3.291%. However, it began to falter after twelve-thirty, which is when it dropped below 10,500 points. The decline continued especially after three in the afternoon when the indicator started drifting, eventually falling below 10,400 points and marking a daily low under 10,350 points. The cause of the declines: Ukraine. The Ukrainian government\'s activity against pro-Russians has reactivated, and meanwhile, the Russian government responded by announcing new maneuvers. From that minimum level, the indicator began a recovery, ending the day at 10,462 points, a revaluation of 0.36%. In the end, what was supposed to be a calm and positive session turned into a quite volatile day. The Spanish selective index performed worse than Italy\'s Ftse Mib and France’s Cac 40, which gained 0.66% and 0.64% respectively, but better than Germany\'s Dax, which only rose by 0.05%. This occurred despite Germany publishing the Ifo index, which measures confidence in the German economy. It rose from 110.7 to 111.2 points, when experts expected it to settle at 110.5 points. Additionally, it increased due to better expectations: in that chapter, the indicator rose from 106.4 to 107.3 points, compared to the 105.8 points that analysts expected. In the evaluation of the current situation, it rose from 115.2 to 115.3 points, when experts expected it to be 115.7 points. Only one index ended in the red: Lisbon\'s PSI-20, which fell by 0.11%. \n\nBoost from the United States\nThe final recovery in Europe had to do with the behavior of the American stock market. There, indices, especially the Nasdaq, which gained around one percentage point, were celebrating the good results from Facebook and Apple and were moving upwards. Among the economic indicators of the day in the United States, the durable goods orders data was very good: they rose by 2.6% in March, above the 2% that analysts expected and higher than the 2.1% growth the previous month. Orders for durable goods excluding transportation rose by 2%, above the 0.6% that analysts expected. Excluding defense, they rose by 1.8%, below the 3% estimated by analysts. More durable goods orders indicate a boost to industrial production. The weekly unemployment data was somewhat worse, rising by 329,000 people, above the 310,000 expected by analysts. Additionally, the Kansas Fed\'s activity index fell from 22 to 12 points.'),

Inditex and Iberdrola rose around 0.35%. On the other hand, Gamesa was the worst performer, dropping by 2.12%. Following it were CaixaBank, Dia, Sacyr, Bankinter, and Jazztel, which fell by more than one percentage point. Bankia and Popular’s losses were close to 1%.

Barón de Ley and Liberbank gained more than three percentage points. In red, the worst performer was Inypsa, with a decline of 9.09%.\n\nSale of practically all bonds\nIn the debt market, the yield of all bonds rose. This means that yesterday, investors sold debt to buy stocks. The yield on the Spanish bond rose from 3.05% to 3.08%. The yield on the Italian bond rose from 3.09% to 3.12%. The yield on the German bond rose from 1.52% to 1.53%. With this behavior, Spain\'s risk premium barely increased from 153 to 155 basis points. Italy\'s risk premium rose from 157 to 159 basis points. In the currency market, the exchange rate between the euro and the dollar ended the day at 1.3824 units. In the commodities market, the Brent barrel rose by 1% to 110 dollars, while West Texas advanced by 0.48% to nearly 102 dollars. The price of gold advanced by 0.30% due to new tensions arising in Ukraine, but it ended the day still below 1,300 dollars, at 1,288 dollars per ounce. \n\nMarket Information\n- Live quotes of the Ibex\n- Continuous market\n- International markets.\nThere are at least 15 kilometers between the parish of the Central University of Venezuela (UCV) and the Eastern Cemetery in Caracas, where the march will take place on foot this Wednesday to transfer the body of councilman Fernando Albán, who was allegedly "murdered" and thrown from the 10th floor of the Sebin tower, the political police, according to opposition parties’ denunciations. The funeral march was called to begin at 11 am, local time, from the university parish to the Eastern Cemetery of La Guairita. The burial has become an act of protest and unity for the opposition to express the anger felt by the people of Caracas over the death of councilman Albán.\n\nFernando Albán, 56, was a councilman for the Libertador municipality of Caracas representing the Primero Justicia party. He was known for being a devout Catholic, which contradicts the official version that he committed suicide after being detained at the Simón Bolívar airport on October 5 when he was returning from the United Nations in New York where he was presenting complaints about the systematic human rights violations in Venezuela. No one has believed the official version that Albán committed suicide from the 10th floor of the Sebin tower, located in Plaza Venezuela, also known as "The Tomb," where political prisoners are tortured.\n\nThe National Assembly held a plenary session on Tuesday in his memory, condemning the politician’s murder. During the parliamentary event, Deputy Juan Miguel Matheus denounced that Fernando Albán was tortured on Sunday night. "On Sunday night they tortured him, and they tortured him in three ways: mechanical asphyxiation with a bag over his face, submersion in a barrel of water, trying to drown him, and with electricity. And in that, he lost his life, in that he died."\n\nFormer governor of Miranda state, Henrique Capriles Radonski, during the funeral services for councilman Fernando Albán at the National Assembly (AN), assured that from his party Primero Justicia (PJ) "we do not buy the story that Fernando Albán would be capable of taking his own life." Capriles Radonski asserted that the worst thing that could happen to Venezuela is for hatred to reign in the country and for something to be constructed on top of that hatred. "If there is a weapon of mass destruction, it is hatred in a situation like this where we are overwhelmed; if there is something we can say at this moment, it is that we want justice and for a transparent investigation to be conducted," he affirmed. He indicated that Venezuela is living on the edge. "What do we want in Venezuela, to kill each other, where the Government paves the way for this country to end in a civil war. Is that the destiny of Venezuela? I wouldn’t want us to be, every day the government contributes to the ground so that things cannot be solved in the way the majority wants, which is a peaceful solution," he said, indicating that he does not believe Albán thought of taking his own life since he was a man of faith and principles.'),

According to the Meteorological Organization, the alert will be active between 2:00 AM and 10:00 AM on Sunday in the Iberian System and the mountains of Teruel, with temperatures reaching -4 and -6 degrees, respectively. This situation will repeat during the same time frame on the following Monday, with temperatures of -6 degrees in the Iberian System and the Mountains of Teruel, and -4 degrees in the central and southern areas of the province of Huesca.\nMADRID.- The alleged fixer of the Púnica corruption network, Alejandro De Pedro, carried out "reputation work" on social media for the former mayor of Madrid, Ana Botella (PP), which he obtained thanks to the mediation of former Labor Minister Eduardo Zaplana and former Mayor of Cartagena, José Antonio Alonso Conesa (PSOE). This is stated in a report by the Civil Guard, which is part of the \'Púnica case\' summary, revealing that the WhatsApp communications intercepted during the procedure show evidence of "the creation of reports on Ana Botella\'s presence on the internet." De Pedro\'s company, Madiva, was also responsible for "creating digital newspapers" in the Community of Madrid and the City\'s Council, some related to the city\'s districts, as well as "possible Google positioning."\n\nInvestigators suspect that the documents seized from the leaders of the Púnica corruption network reveal "a possible commercial relationship" between Madiva and the media agency Irismedia, which could have acted as the payer for these online reputation services. The report, prepared by the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the Civil Guard on May 27, 2014, confirms that De Pedro carried out "reputation work on the network for authorities and elected officials, which created a debt in his favor," paid via "irregular procedures." These included "direct payments or invoicing through third-party companies awarded public contracts, including the cost of these reputation works in public contracts intended for other purposes," or direct benefits to De Pedro in "subsequent public contracting processes."\n\nSpecifically, De Pedro worked for the Community of Madrid, the Provincial Councils of León and Alicante, and the city councils of Valencia, Castellón de la Plana, Majadahonda and Coslada (Madrid), Gandía (Valencia), Denia, Benissa, and Villajoyosa (Alicante), and Cartagena (Murcia). In Madrid\'s case, the Civil Guard reports that De Pedro started working for the PP of Madrid in 2010 and 2011, "possibly through Francisco Granados," then the organization\'s Secretary-General. This allowed him to offer his services to "different city councils in the Community of Madrid as a result of the 2011 elections, continuing in some until the operation\'s exploitation date," in October 2014.'),
 Document(page_content='He was pursuing this ambition until he joined the Spanish-speaking pro-independence platform Súmate in 2013. Within two years, he rose from anonymity to the National Secretariat of the Catalan National Assembly and — reportedly with the blessing of Oriol Junqueras — headed the list for Barcelona of the Republican Left of Catalonia (Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya) in the December 20 elections. \n\nHis decade of experience as a recruiter seemed to give him the serious demeanor, languid tone, and gentlemanly posture that marked his debut in the Parliament — a style that didn\'t go unnoticed. His speech was described variously as "tabloid" and "low-cost sentimentalism," and marked his entry into the political star system as the deputy spokesperson for ERC in Congress.\n\n"Toni Comín recently called me a \'bullfighter.\' That\'s pretty accurate. I\'ve had many people over time tell me, \'When you\'re up there, try to speak for all of us.\' That\'s what I humbly try to do, and it\'s an honor. There’s no vanity or personal agenda. Tardà is generous, tremendously humane. He doesn’t know envy. He’s great. A star. I have to clarify this almost every time in interviews: I didn’t say \'I’m a charnego\'; I said, \'I\'m what you call charnego,\' which is a term used by the more reactionary unionists. Just search it on Twitter to see that it\'s used by people like Hermman Tertsch or Urdazi. That was my point, and that\'s why Ciudadanos got so upset. They know well that those calling us \'charnegos\' — and that’s putting it mildly — are the platforms supporting them.\n\nPedro Sánchez is a kind of Zapatero who leans to the right of Zapatero. In our meeting with him, we told him, \'Pedro, it would be great, especially for your PSC colleagues, if you referred to Catalonia as a nation.\' He refused. That places him on the right. Maybe that\'s why he\'s so comfortable with the pact with this new right-wing party, Ciudadanos. It\'s disappointing, but anyone who buys into the centrist or reformist discourse of Ciudadanos is mistaken. Just look at the records of the Parliament over the past nine years. C\'s is not the new democratic party they pretend to be. It’s the National Front. It’s a party that stands to the right of the PP on many issues.\n\nIt\'s part of normalcy in a democracy that such meetings occur. What’s surprising is that a meeting between two people who are many things should be news. The abnormality lies in the last four years, where no one has been talking to anyone. In the whirlwind of Madrid, you’re somewhat removed from the day-to-day of Catalan politics. I don\'t know if he knew or not. What I do know for sure is that the relationship between Puigdemont and Junqueras is tremendously good. That’s indisputable.\n\nI have no idea. If they did, I’m convinced Junqueras would convey what we’ve been saying from the start: we will not support those who call us coup plotters, as Rodríguez Ibarra recently called Joan Tardà, simply because we voted for something they don\'t like. We will never support those who deny the full sovereignty of the people of Catalonia. It’s a science fiction scenario. If Pedro Sánchez were to strike a deal with Podemos, calls from Susana Díaz, Felipe González, or Ms. Botín would be immediate. They would remind him that the party for order, the IBEX 35’s party, and the correct path is with Ciudadanos. It seems impossible, though it would be great for the PSOE to return to its left-wing roots.\n\nWe think it\'s positive for everyone to talk with everyone. What’s surprising is that Pablo Iglesias thinks that 27 MPs — those of Catalonia Sí que es Pot and the PSC in Parliament — should decide the future of Catalonia, when Junts pel Sí and the CUP have a parliamentary majority of 72 seats. It’s surprising that Iglesias tries to sell this narrative. The solution has been provided by the people with an absolute pro-independence majority, which is the only way forward.\n\nI was referring to the letter Minister Montoro sent to Junqueras; a crude letter with a veiled threat: Cut more, make your people suffer even more. We are very used to the Spanish State Government using institutions, even judicial halls, against the vote of the people. We know the Constitutional Court very well, presided over by a PP member. And we know Montoro perfectly well. It would be better if instead of sending threatening letters to the autonomous communities, the government stopped bailing out their banker friends, which has cost 100 billion euros. If Montoro\'s friends governed Catalonia, certain things would not have happened. For example, Catalonia would not have paid 1900 million euros in interest for something called FLA, which is outrageous and indecent, as it exploits public taxes for profit. I’m also convinced that the Constitutional Court would not act against the popular mandate if others were in power. Whether liked or not, even non-independentists would agree that the government uses institutions against Catalan institutions.'),

The incident took place in the early hours of this Sunday in the Benimaclet neighborhood. The 092 emergency number received a report that a man was banging on a door, the municipal security force stated in a communiqué. The woman informed the officers that her ex-partner had been harassing her for several months and that on that day, he had come to her residence to try to enter and insult her.

They are also the basic materials used to make cans, an almost immortal container whose essential properties do not deteriorate no matter how many times it is recycled, according to the Spanish Metal Packaging Association. They are also tough nuts to crack for nature: depending on their composition and thickness, a can may take more than 100 years to degrade outdoors. For this reason, they are used massively to protect almost anything: liquids, food, cleaning products, chemicals, paints, and even tennis balls.\n\nWHAT YOU NEED: A can. A candle. Pencil and punch.

In the past three months, humanitarian agencies in these countries have recorded an average of more than 500 Syrian refugees per day. 75% of them are women and children, and the UN estimates that the number might reach 185,000 by the end of the year. The actual number of refugees is likely higher, as many fear registering with the UN, concerned it might compromise their chances of returning to Syria. The majority of them "are entirely dependent on humanitarian aid to survive," Moumtzis states. \n\nThe United Nations has managed to partially implement its humanitarian aid plan in Syria, but the daily deterioration of the situation means the needs of the population cannot be met, the international organization warned today. "People who two months ago were coping with an emergency situation can no longer manage now, and as the insecurity does not cease but increases, the needs grow exponentially," declared John Ging, the Director of Operations of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, during a press conference in Geneva.\n\nThe UN estimates $193 million —157.4 million euros— in essential funds to assist the refugees, and $189 million —154.1 million euros— in necessary aid for the 1.5 million Syrians who need humanitarian assistance within the country. The agency has only 20% of that amount.'),

The Galician team explains that after the Court of Instruction in Valencia did not admit the club’s involvement in the criminal procedure, the appeal prepared by the Garrigues law firm has been successful and it "will allow [the club] to defend its rights and interests" in the case. Deportivo believes that "there are sufficient elements that make the club from Coruña the main aggrieved party by the events under scrutiny." The result of the match between 99cx3 and Zaragoza and Deportivo\'s defeat at Riazor against Valencia (0-2) on the last day of the 2010-11 season, led the blanquiazules to be relegated to the Segunda División that year.

 Document(page_content='Spicer was responding to a message circulated among U.S. diplomats worldwide, which, according to some media outlets, has received more than 100 signatures before being sent to the State Department\'s so-called "dissent channel." This channel has been in place since the Vietnam War (1955-1975) to allow employees to express their disagreement with senior U.S. diplomatic officials without fear of retaliation, and documents filed there must receive an official response within 30 to 60 days.\n\nIn the message, diplomats expressed their opposition to the part of the executive order signed by Trump on Friday that bans citizens from Libya, Sudan, Somalia, Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and Iran from entering the country for 90 days. "This ban, which can only be lifted under conditions that countries will find difficult or impossible to meet, will not achieve its stated goal of protecting the American people from terrorist attacks by foreign nationals entering the United States," the document\'s signatories warned. "Moreover, this policy contravenes important American values like non-discrimination, fair play, and welcoming foreign visitors and immigrants," they added.\n\nActing State Department spokesman Mark Toner said today he was "aware" of that message and defended the need for agency employees to be able to register their disagreement with certain policies within the "dissent channel." "This is an important process that the acting Secretary of State (Thomas Shannon) and the State Department as a whole value and respect. It allows employees to express their differing views on a policy candidly and privately to the agency\'s leaders," Toner said in a statement.\n\nThe signatories of the document, which was published by several media outlets, warned that the ban will "immediately sour relations" with the seven affected countries and much of the Muslim world, which sees the prohibition as religion-motivated. "By alienating them, we lose access to the intelligence and resources we need to address the root causes of terrorism abroad before an attack occurs in our country," the diplomats argued, also expressing concern about a rise in "anti-American sentiment" globally. They also warned that the requirement imposed on countries to lift the ban—ensuring that each individual applying for a visa is who they claim to be and not a threat—is too "vague and nebulous" for those governments to be able or willing to comply.\nÁlvaro Cunqueiro, \'a Houdini of literature\'. / Archive.

This new installment in the Fundamental Work collection of the Fundación Banco Santander showcases over a hundred forgotten texts by the unique and great Galician narrator, brought to light by Galician philologist and professor Xosé Antonio López Silva. Among them are seven entirely secular and unpublished stories not included in any book or anthology, which Cunqueiro \'snuck\' into a Catholic magazine under the pseudonym Álvaro Labrada. The book offers a journey through the texts and hagiographic portrayals of a prolific and protean Álvaro Cunqueiro (Mondoñedo, 1911-Vigo, 1981). \n\nThe seven unpublished stories, with exotic settings, sometimes Chinese, sometimes Indian, were discovered in 2011 by the volume\'s anthologist, López Silva, who is committed to "recapturing the value of a writer with an inimitable style" and providing an overview of a theme "so relevant, distinctive, and enormously functional in Cunqueiro\'s work, which is hagiography." The stories, which went unnoticed by critics despite being crucial in Cunqueiro\'s trajectory, were written between 1945 and 1946, after the Franco regime stripped him of his journalist credentials in 1944. Xosé Antonio López Silva found them while analyzing other hagiographic texts. These saints, for the Lucense writer, were "magicians like Merlin," as César Antonio Molina explains in the prologue. "Cunqueiro uses the saints for his own inventions, without relying in the slightest on the official history of the Church and its truth," assures the former minister. "They are saints that the Catholic Church couldn\'t teach in its schools and seminaries, created by someone who isn\'t heretical but who commits marvelous excesses," Molina specifies.'),
 Document(page_content="No, we are stronger than ever. During the three months of negotiations for the Catalan government, we were called everything under the sun, and now they're back at it. There's a notable cover from El Periódico from that time headlined: 'At the Edge of the Precipice.' The other day it read: 'The Great Hope' with a photo of Sánchez and Iglesias. Back then, we were negotiating between political formations even more distant than those negotiating in the Spanish state now. CDC and the CUP have nothing in common. And it was done. The important thing is not to win against each other but to win a country. We must remember there’s an absolute parliamentary majority. And just like in other European countries, we must accept that deals are made, not minimal ones, but those reaching the last minute or with nuances. We must get used to it. I wish this happened in the Spanish Parliament where relatively distant political formations could agree for a goal that transcends them.\n\nWe have agreed on 18 months. But we always say the same: we are facing the biggest political challenge in southern Europe in a long time. We are starting a self-determination process — no more, no less — that requires time, patience, generosity… If it’s 18 months, fine, if it’s 20, also fine. What's clear is that we will do it.\n\nThe bitter controversy, as someone published the other day, was started by him. He dedicated an article to me — 'The Rufián Case' — portraying me almost as a Frankenstein. The irony is that exclusionary Spanish nationalists call exclusionary Catalan nationalists left-wing independents, like me. If you don’t like certain languages being spoken, certain symbols being reclaimed, or certain identities being voted on, you end up being the exclusionary nationalist. People like Mr. Pérez-Reverte are very upset because they don’t understand that people here vote differently, that the PP is a residual party, and that the PSOE is taking the same path. It is confusing, but it’s called democracy. If they insult us… that's on them. It reflects what Ciudadanos is. Félix de Azúa is one of their founders, a totem of C's. His comments, more than being misogynistic or right-wing, are classist. He doesn’t understand or like that people like Ada Colau, who has been a great civil and social rights activist, reach political institutions. They don’t like people like me either, with all humility. I studied Labor Relations and a master’s in Human Resources Management. For 10 years, I was the guy sitting on the other side of the table during job interviews. It’s true that I unloaded inflatable fair trucks and worked as a clerk for a while. But like many other people, I worked to pay for my studies. No, I’m not a 'compi-yogui,' nor do I share that fraternity with Panama.\nThe ordinance against street prostitution is back in the spotlight in Valencia. The Socialist spokesperson for the municipal group, Joan Calabuig, offered this morning at a public appearance to renegotiate with the PP (People’s Party) the regulation aimed at curbing this activity, which has been highly criticized in neighborhoods such as Velluters and La Punta. Calabuig stressed that the municipal groups must respond to the complaints from residents, which have increased this summer in the city center. To this end, he asked the City Council to study how the ordinance has worked in other cities, in addition to the draft approved by the Federation of Municipalities and Provinces a year ago. However, Calabuig emphasized, in response to questions from Z28v6, that the sanctions should be primarily directed at the clients and not the prostitutes, who are often victims of the mafias running this business. Moreover, he advocated for offering social solutions involving professionals, as well as urban improvements in these neighborhoods. During the last term, the ordinance was on the verge of being approved but was shelved due to a lack of consensus between the PP and the PSPV (the Socialist Party of the Valencian Community). In the Community, municipalities such as Alicante have been operating under it for some time.\nFrom Kafka's metamorphosis to the carnivorous ants in comic books, and including Kurt Neumann's *The Fly* (1958) and its depressing sequel by David Cronenberg (1986), which was more disgusting than scary, narrators of novels and films have been obsessed with insects for over a century. Insects are not only strikingly ugly but also tend to move in swarms, hordes, or plagues to torment the human species. This is a form of large-scale racism because insects are not hominids, primates, tetrapods, nor even deuterostomes; they are merely vulgar arthropods and hexapods. Their bad reputation, however, is largely due to a solid scientific reason: they bite and transmit serious diseases such as malaria, which infects 200 million people each year and kills, roughly speaking, about 400,000 children under five years old.")]
