    "## Elasticsearch and Tokenizer Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "This section sets up the necessary configurations for connecting to Elasticsearch and initializing the tokenizers used for text processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuration Details:\n",
    "1. **Elasticsearch Credentials**:\n",
    "   - `ELASTIC_CLOUD_ID`: The Cloud ID for the Elasticsearch cluster, securely fetched using the `getpass` function.\n",
    "   - `ELASTIC_API_KEY`: The API key for Elasticsearch authentication, securely fetched using the `getpass` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Index Settings**:\n",
    "   - `raw_source_index`: The name of the index for the raw dataset (`harry_potter_dataset-raw`).\n",
    "   - `index_name`: The name of the enriched dataset index (`harry_potter_dataset_enriched`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Embedding Models**:\n",
    "   - `dense_embedding_model_id`: Specifies the model used for generating dense embeddings (`sentence-transformers__all-minilm-l6-v2`).\n",
    "   - `dense_huggingface_model_id`: The Hugging Face model ID for the dense embeddings (`sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`).\n",
    "   - `dense_model_number_of_allocators`: The number of allocators for the dense embedding model (2).\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "   - `elser_model_id`: Specifies the ELSER model ID (`.elser_model_2_linux-x86_64`).\n",
    "   - `elser_model_number_of_allocators`: The number of allocators for the ELSER model (2).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Tokenizer Initialization**:\n",
    "   - `bert_tokenizer`: Initializes the BERT tokenizer (`bert-base-uncased`) for English text processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Chunking Parameters**:\n",
    "   - `SEMANTIC_SEARCH_TOKEN_LIMIT`: Sets the token limit for each chunk (500 tokens per chunk, considering space for special tokens).\n",
    "   - `ELSER_TOKEN_OVERLAP`: Defines the overlap ratio between chunks (default is 0%, customizable for context continuity).\n",
    "\n",
    "These configurations ensure that the necessary components are properly set up for efficient text processing, indexing, and search operations in Elasticsearch.\n"

    "## Custom Search Query Construction and Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "This section constructs and executes a custom search query in Elasticsearch, utilizing a hybrid approach combining vector and text-based search methods to enhance search accuracy and relevance. The specific example used is a user query about the \"Nimbus 2000\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Steps:\n",
    "1. **Define User Query**: The user query is specified as \"what is a nimbus 2000\".\n",
    "2. **Set Boost Factors**:\n",
    "   - `knn_boost_factor`: A value to amplify the importance of the vector-based search component.\n",
    "   - `text_expansion_boost`: A value to modify the weight of the text-based search component.\n",
    "3. **Build Query**: The `build_custom_query` function constructs the search query, incorporating both dense vector and text expansion components.\n",
    "4. **Execute Search**: The query is executed against the specified Elasticsearch index.\n",
    "5. **Identify Relevant Passages**:\n",
    "   - The search results are analyzed to find the passage with the highest relevance score.\n",
    "   - The ID and chunk number of the best matching passage are captured and printed.\n",
    "6. **Fetch Surrounding Chunks**: Constructs and executes a query to retrieve chunks adjacent to the identified passage for broader context. If the matched chunk is the first chunk, fetches n, n+1, and n+2. If the chunk is the last chunk in the chapter, fetches n, n-1, and n-2. For other chunks, fetches n-1, n, and n+1.\n",
    "7. **Display Results**: Outputs text from the relevant and adjacent passages."
