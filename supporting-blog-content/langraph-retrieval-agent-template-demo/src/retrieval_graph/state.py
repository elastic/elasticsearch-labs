"""State management for the retrieval graph.

This module defines the state structures and reduction functions used in the
retrieval graph. It includes definitions for document indexing, retrieval,
and conversation management.

Classes:
    IndexState: Represents the state for document indexing operations.
    RetrievalState: Represents the state for document retrieval operations.
    ConversationState: Represents the state of the ongoing conversation.

Functions:
    reduce_docs: Processes and reduces document inputs into a sequence of Documents.
    reduce_retriever: Updates the retriever in the state.
    reduce_messages: Manages the addition of new messages to the conversation state.
    reduce_retrieved_docs: Handles the updating of retrieved documents in the state.

The module also includes type definitions and utility functions to support
these state management operations.

    Typically accumulates a pattern of Human/AI/Human/AI messages; if

    it may look like this:

    1. HumanMessage - user input

    3. ToolMessage(s) - the responses (or errors) from the executed tools

    4. AIMessage without .tool_calls - agent responding in unstructured
        format to the user.

    5. HumanMessage - user responds with the next conversational turn.

    Merges two lists of messages, updating existing messages by ID.
