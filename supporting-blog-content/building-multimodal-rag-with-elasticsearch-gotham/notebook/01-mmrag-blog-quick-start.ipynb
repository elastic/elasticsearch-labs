      "\n",
      "- **Visual Evidence:** The photos of the crime scene are highly indicative of the Joker's involvement. The presence of playing cards scattered around a dark, rain-soaked alley is a well-known signature of the Joker, serving as both his calling card and a symbol of his chaotic nature. The graffiti depicting the Joker laughing is a visual taunt and a mark of territory, further implicating him. The similarity score of 0.83 for both photos suggests a high degree of confidence in the visual match to known patterns of the Joker's previous crimes.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Auditory Evidence:** The sinister laugh captured near the crime scene, with a similarity score of 1.00, is a direct auditory signature of the Joker. This laugh is not only iconic but has been documented in numerous encounters with law enforcement and victims. The perfect match indicates that the laugh is either directly from the Joker or a recording meant to signify his presence or involvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Textual Evidence:** The mysterious note found at the location, with a similarity score of 0.76, suggests a cryptic message or clue left behind by the criminal. While the content of the note is not detailed, the Joker is known for leaving such notes as part of his psychological games and clues to his next move. The similarity score indicates a strong but not perfect match to known writings of the Joker, possibly due to variations in the message or medium used.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Depth Evidence:** The depth sensor capture of the suspect, with a similarity score of 0.77, suggests a figure that matches the physical profile of the Joker. While depth captures can be less definitive in identifying specific facial features, the height, build, and posture can be compared against known data of the Joker.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Behavioral Patterns:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The Joker is characterized by his love for chaos, dramatic flair, and leaving symbolic markers at his crime scenes. The combination of playing cards, the sinister laugh, and the cryptic note all align with his known behavioral patterns. His motives often include creating disorder, challenging Batman, and leaving a signature that unmistakably points to him, all of which are evident in this case.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Confidence Level:** 95%\n",
      "\n",
      "The evidence strongly points to the Joker as the prime suspect due to the convergence of visual, auditory, textual, and depth data that aligns with his known patterns and behaviors. The slight deductions in confidence are due to the inherent limitations in depth sensor identification and the slightly lower similarity score of the textual evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Next Steps:** No further evidence required.\n",
      "\n",
      "The combination of multimodal evidence provides a comprehensive and conclusive identification of the Joker as the perpetrator. However, capturing additional direct visual confirmation of the Joker at the scene or obtaining a confession would only serve to reinforce the already strong case.\n",
