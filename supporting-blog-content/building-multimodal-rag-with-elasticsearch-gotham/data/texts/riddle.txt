HAHAHA! 

Dear Detective,

In a city of endless night, a new game unfolds
Where chaos reigns and fear takes hold
I left a gift at Gotham Central Bank
Time's ticking, your mind goes blank

The clues are there, scattered with care
Each laugh echoes everywhere
Midnight strikes, you won't catch me
In Gotham's heart, chaos runs free!

With a smile,
?
