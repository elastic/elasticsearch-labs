## Usage

### Updating configuration

The project is configured via a JSON [config file](src/config/engine.json). This file has been automatically generated for you when downloading this project. If you would like to make configuration changes, there is no need to regenerate this app from your App Search Dashboard. Additional configuration can be made by modifying that file.

You can simply open up the
[engine.json](src/config/engine.json) file, update the [options](#config),
and then restart this app.

### Configuration options <a id="config"></a>

The following is a complete list of options available for configuration in [engine.json](src/config/engine.json).

## Building and embedding

To embed this application into a website, it can be built into static assets using the following command:
```
npm run build
```

This will create two files in the `build` directory:
```
build/static/js/main.<hash>.js
build/static/css/main.<hash>.css
```

Include the built static assets as well as an element with `id="root"`. For example:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <script defer="defer" src="/static/js/main.<hash>.js"></script>
    <link href="/static/css/main.<hash>.css" rel="stylesheet" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root" class="app-container"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Deploy and Share

This app can be easily published to any server as static assets and served. We recommend [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), but you have other [options](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) as well.

To deploy:

```
npm run build
npm install netlify-cli -g
netlify deploy # enter ./build as the deploy path
```

You'll then simply follow the command prompt to log into Netlify and deploy your site. This can be completed in just a few minutes.

### External configuration

If you are embedding this app inside of another page, and you would like to
source the configuration from outside of the `engine.json` file,
you can simply write the configuration directly to `window.appConfig`.

### If you are checking this project out directly from GitHub... <a id="github"></a>

You can follow the previous steps, but then you will need to create and configure
[engine.json](src/config/engine.json).

To do so, make a copy of [engine.json.example](src/config/engine.json.example),
rename it to `engine.json` and configure it with your Engine's specific details.

```bash
cp src/config/engine.json.example src/config/engine.json
```

## Customization

This project is built with [Search UI](https://github.com/elastic/search-ui), which is a React library for building search experiences. If you're interested in using this project as a base for your own, most of
what you'll need can be found in the Search UI documentation.
