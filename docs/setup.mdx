## Run ((es))

You need an ((es)) instance to use our examples (including notebooks).
You can start using ((es)) really quickly.
Learn how to use Docker for local development and testing, and Elastic Cloud for production use.

### Use ((es)) with Docker

The quickest way to get started developing with ((es)) is to use Docker. Run the following command to download and launch the official ((es)) Docker image:

```bash
docker run -p 9200:9200 \
  -e "discovery.type=single-node" \
  -e "xpack.security.enabled=false" \
  -e "xpack.security.http.ssl.enabled=false" \
  -e "xpack.license.self_generated.type=trial" \
  docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.9.0 # Update to current version as needed
```

((es)) is now running on http://localhost:9200.
