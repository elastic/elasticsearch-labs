{/* Consider reusing some ESRE docs FAQs

### Does Elasticsearch support vector search?

Yes! Elasticsearch supports vector search using:
- Dense vectors with the [dense vector field type](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/dense-vector.html)
- Sparse vectors with the [rank feature field type](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/rank-feature.html)

### Can I do semantic search with Elasticsearch?

Yes! You have many options for semantic search with Elasticsearch.
For example, you can use an embedding model, such as [sentence-transformers](https://www.sbert.net/), to transform your text into vectors and store these in Elasticsearch.

Then you can use Elasticsearch's vector search capabilities to find similar documents.

### Can I combine semantic search and full-text search?

Yes! You can combine semantic search and full-text search in what's known as a "hybrid" query strategy.
Hybrid search involves retrieving relevant documents using both vector search and full-text search,
and balancing the scores from both queries using a ranking algorithm.
