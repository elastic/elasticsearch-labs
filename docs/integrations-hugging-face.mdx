[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/docs) is an open-source hub dedicated to AI/ML models and tools, offering access to a vast collection of machine learning models.
This platform makes it easy to incorporate specialized AI and ML functionalities into your applications.

You can use Hugging Face models with ((es)) in two ways:

### Transformers library

Leverage the Transformers Python library to carry out inference within a Python backend environment.

### Hosted models in ((es))

Deploy Hugging Face models directly in ((es)) to perform inference within the ((es)) environment.
