**((es))** is a battle-tested data store, search engine, and analytics solution, that powers the [Elastic Stack](https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack).
It allows you to store and retrieve relevant information extremely quickly.
((es)) is used by many of the world's largest companies to power their search and analytics applications.

You can use ((es)) as a **vector database** to store vector embeddings and perform vector similarity search.
((es)) supports many different types of queries, including full-text search, geospatial search, and more.

((es)) also enables tasks like question-answering, summarization, and classification by serving relevant context to generative AI models,
in what's known as **retrieval augmented generation (RAG)**.
