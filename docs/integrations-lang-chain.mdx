[LangChain](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/) is a popular framework for working with AI, Vectors, and embeddings. Used to simplify building a variety of AI applications.

((es)) can be used with LangChain in two ways:

- Use the LangChain VectorStore to store and retrieve documents from ((es))
- Use the LangChain self-query retriever, with the help of an LLM like OpenAI, to transform a user's query into a query + filter to retrieve relevant documents from ((es)).
