Elasticsearch supports a number of REST clients for different languages.

- Python: [view official docs](https://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.io/en/master/)
- Javascript: [view official docs](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/getting-started-js.html)

For other clients, see our [Client Libraries](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/index.html).

<DocCallOut title="">
    ℹ️ Because ML and Generative AI are strongly Python-based, our examples focus on the Python client.
    Our interactive notebooks also use the Python client.
