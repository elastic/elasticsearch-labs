### Install

To install the client, run the following command:


```bash
pip install elasticsearch
```

### Connecting to Elasticsearch

Learn how to connect to Elasticsearch using the Python client.

- [Localhost example](#example-localhost)
- [Elastic Cloud with API Key example](#example-elastic-cloud-with-api-key)
- [Elastic Cloud with Username and Password example](#example-elastic-cloud-with-username-and-password)

#### Example: Localhost

```python
from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch

es = Elasticsearch(["http://localhost:9200"])
```

#### Example: Elastic Cloud with API Key

Follow these steps to create an API key in Kibana:

1. Go to **Management > Stack Management > Security > API Keys**
2. Click "Create API Key"
3. Give the API Key a name and click "Create"
4. Copy the API key (base64 encoded)

```python
from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch

es = Elasticsearch(
  cloud_id="YOUR_CLOUD_ID",
  api_key="YOUR_API_KEY"
)
```

#### Example: Elastic Cloud with Username and Password

Your password is printed to the screen when you create your Elastic Cloud deployment. If you can't find it, you can reset it by going to:

1. **Elastic Cloud Console > Deployment > Security > Reset Password**
2. Copy the password

This will reset the password for the `elastic` user.

```python
from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch

es = Elasticsearch(
  cloud_id="YOUR_CLOUD_ID",
  http_auth=("elastic", "<password>"),
)
```

### Validate Connection

To validate that you have connected to Elasticsearch, run the following command.

This should return cluster information if setup was successful.


```python
es.info()
```
