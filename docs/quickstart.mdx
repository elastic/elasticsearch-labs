<DocCallOut title="Set up Elasticsearch">
This section assumes you have an <DocLink id="genaiSetup" text="((es)) setup"/>, so you can start using the API Client to index and search documents.
</DocCallOut>

Quickly get started indexing and querying ((es)) documents using our Python API Client.

You can quick start in two ways:

1. Use our [Quick start Python notebook](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-labs/blob/main/notebooks/search/00-quick-start.ipynb) for a concrete, interactive example of indexing and searching with ((es)).
This doesn't require any local setup.
2. Follow the commands below and run them in your local development environment.

## Run locally

### Install Python client

Run the following command to install the ((es)) Python client:

```bash
$ python -m pip install elasticsearch
```

### Initialize the client

We need to initialize the client to start using it.
In this example, we assume you are using [Elastic Cloud](https://cloud.elastic.co) and have a Cloud ID and password.

```python
from elasticsearch import ((es))

es = ((es))(
    cloud_id=CLOUD_ID,
    basic_auth=("elastic", CLOUD_PASSWORD)
)
```

### Create an Index

An index is a collection of documents that have similar characteristics.
For example, you might have an index for "products" and another index for "users".

In this example, let's create an index called `demo` with a mapping for the `text` field.
With this mapping, we will be able to store 8 dimentional vectors in the `text` field.
When we search for similar documents, we will use the `cosine` similarity function.

```python
es.indices.create(index="demo", mappings={
  "properties": {
    "text": {
      "type": "dense_vector",
      "dims": 8,
      "similarity": "cosine",
      "index": True
    }
  }
})
```

To check if the index was created, you can run the following command:

```python
es.indices.get(index="demo")
```

### Index Documents

Lets start by ingesting vectors into your index, using the [bulk helper](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/python-api/current/client-helpers.html#bulk-helpers).

```python
from elasticsearch.helpers import bulk

docs = [
  { "text": [0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5], "title": "Document 1"},
  { "text": [0.4, 0.4, 0.4, 0.4, 0.4, 0.4, 0.4, 0.4], "title": "Document 2"},
  { "text": [0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3], "title": "Document 3"}
]

actions = []
for doc in docs:
  action = {
      "_index": "demo",
      "_source": doc
  }
  actions.append(action)

bulk(es, actions, refresh=True)

```

We use `refresh` to make sure the documents are available for search immediately.

### Search for similar documents

Now that we have indexed some documents, we can search for similar documents that are most similar to the query vector.

We will calculate the distance with the cosine similarity function, and return the top 10 most similar documents.

```python
response = es.search(index="demo", body={
    "knn": {
      "field": "text",
      "query_vector": [0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5],
      "k": 10,
      "num_candidates": 100
    }
})
```
