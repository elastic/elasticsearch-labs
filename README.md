# Elasticsearch Examples & Apps

This repository contains executable Python notebooks, sample apps, and resources for testing out the Elastic platform:

- Learn how to use Elasticsearch as a vector database to store embeddings, power hybrid and semantic search experiences, and more.
- Test Elastic's leading-edge, out-of-the-box capabilities like the [Elastic Learned Sparse Encoder](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/machine-learning/current/ml-nlp-elser.html) and [reciprocal rank fusion (RRF)](<https://www.elastic.co/blog/whats-new-elastic-enterprise-search-8-9-0#hybrid-search-with-reciprocal-rank-fusion-(rrf)-combines-multiple-search-techniques-for-better-results>), which produce best-in-class results without training or tuning.
- Integrate with projects like OpenAI, Hugging Face, and LangChain to use Elasticsearch as the backbone of your LLM-powered applications. For use cases like retrieval augmented generation (RAG), summarization, and question answering (QA).
