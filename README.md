# Elasticsearch Examples & Apps

This repo contains executable Python notebooks, sample apps, and resources for testing out the Elastic platform:

- Learn how to use Elasticsearch as a vector database to store embeddings, power hybrid and semantic search experiences.
- Build use cases such as retrieval augmented generation (RAG), summarization, and question answering (QA).
- Test Elastic's leading-edge, out-of-the-box capabilities like the [Elastic Learned Sparse Encoder](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/machine-learning/current/ml-nlp-elser.html) and [reciprocal rank fusion (RRF)](<https://www.elastic.co/blog/whats-new-elastic-enterprise-search-8-9-0#hybrid-search-with-reciprocal-rank-fusion-(rrf)-combines-multiple-search-techniques-for-better-results>), which produce best-in-class results without training or tuning.
- Integrate with projects like OpenAI, Hugging Face, and LangChain, and use Elasticsearch as the backbone of your LLM-powered applications. 

Elastic enables all modern search experiences powered by AI/ML.

# Developer Guide üìñ

The [`developer-guide`](developer-guide.md) contains resources for developers who want to learn how to use Elasticsearch for vector search and other use cases.

# Python notebooks üìí

The [`notebooks`](notebooks/README.md) folder contains a range of executable Python notebooks, so you can test these features out for yourself. Colab provides an easy-to-use Python virtual environment in the browser.
